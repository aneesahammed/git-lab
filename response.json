  richcontent: '1. Fear is a bigger obstacle than the obstacle itself\r\n' +
    '“Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a 
second’s encounter with God and with eternity.”\r\n' +
    'Any new pursuit requires entering uncharted territory — that’s scary. But with any great risk comes great reward. The experiences you gain in pursuing your dream will make it all worthwhile.\r\n
' +
    '2. What is “true” will always endure\r\n' +
    '“If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothi
ng on your return.”\r\n' +
    'Truth cannot be veiled by smoke and mirrors — it will always stand firm. When you’re searching for the “right” decision, it will be the one that withstands the tests of time and the weight of sc
rutiny.\r\n' +
    '3. Break the monotony\r\n' +
    '“When each day is the same as the next, it’s because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.”\r\n' +
    'Gratitude is the practice of finding the good in each day. Life can easily become stagnant, mundane, and monotonous, but that changes depending on what we choose to see. There’s always a silver 
lining, if you look for it.\r\n' +
    '4. Embrace the present\r\n' +
    '“Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man.”\r\n' +
    'There’s no point dwelling in the past and letting it define you, nor getting lost and anxious about the future. But in the present moment, you’re in the field of possibility — how you engage with the present moment will direct your life.\r\n' +
    '5. Your success has a ripple-effect\r\n' +
    '“That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.”\r\n' +
    'Growth, change, and evolution are weaved into the fabric of reality. Becoming a better version of yourself creates a ripple effect that benefits everything around you: your lifestyle, your family, your friends, your community.\r\n' +
    '6. Make the decision\r\n' +
    '“When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he has never dreamed of when he first made the decision.”\r\n' +
    'It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the unknowns and finer details of your dreams. Actions will flow out of having confidence in your decision; sitting on the fence will get you nowhere.\r\n' +
    '7. Be unrealistic\r\n' +
    '“I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.”\r\n' +
    'Some of the greatest inventions would not have happened if people chose to accept the world as it is. Great achievements and innovations begin with a mindset that ignores the impossible.\r\n' +
    '8. Keep getting back up\r\n' +
    '“The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.”\r\n' +
    'Because the eighth time could be your breakthrough. Some of the greatest novels in history were published after receiving hundreds of rejections. Thankfully, those authors never gave up.\r\n' +
    '9. Focus on your own journey\r\n' +
    '“If someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.”\r\n' +
    'It’s easy to be influenced by others, but you’ll be miserable if you end up living someone else’s life. There’s nothing wrong with taking advice and learning from others, but make sure it aligns with your desires and passions.\r\n' +
    '10. Always take action\r\n' +
    '“There is only one way to learn. It’s through action.”\r\n' +
    'You can study, read, and listen until you turn blue in the face, but the full experience is when you take action, and let the rubber meet the road. Once you’re done aiming, pull the trigger.',
